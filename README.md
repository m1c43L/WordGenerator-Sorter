# WordGenerator-Sorter
Simple word generator...

 * To help one in answering a word scramble puzzle, this program
 * generate words from given sets of characters. the words generated
 * in this file came from a words.txt file that I copied from 
 * "http://www.mieliestronk.com/wordlist.html" which is clearly not mine.
 * To be consice, this program is simply a word sorter; nonetheless, I want
 * to call it word generator.
 
 The program contains a straigthforwards GUI that is very easy to use. 
 simply enter the sequnce of characters you want to be in a word then 
 by pressing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or showall, it will generate words from the
 words.txt file that contains the characters you inputted.
 
 Note: words from words.txt file are all spelled int British English.
       Therefore, when one type color(American way), the word color itself will not appear in the list
       because the British English spelling for color is colour. Similaryly armor(American) is armour (British) etc..
